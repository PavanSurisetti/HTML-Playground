       Frames
------------------------
Frames in HTML were used to split the browser window into multiple sections (or "frames"),
each of which could display a separate HTML document.
This allowed multiple web pages to be shown simultaneously within a single browser window.
Main HTML Elements for Frames:
<frameset>:

The <frameset> element is used to define a set of frames.
It replaced the <body> element for the layout of the page.
Inside a <frameset>, you can use <frame> tags to specify the content that each frame will show.
<frame>:

This element is used inside the <frameset> to specify the content that each frame will display.
It can load an external web page or a local HTML document in the frame.
<noframes>:

The <noframes> tag is used to provide alternative content for browsers that don't support frames.
This tag is usually placed inside the <frameset> tag.

Attributes for <frame> Element:
Here are some common attributes used with the <frame> tag:

src: Specifies the URL of the document that the frame will display.
name: Specifies a name for the frame. This can be used when linking to the frame from other parts of the webpage.
width and height: Specifies the dimensions of the frame.
scrolling: Defines if the frame should allow scrolling (values: yes, no, auto).
border: Sets the thickness of the border around the frame (can be 0 for no border).
